# Simple Counter
# In the given List using looping iterable list make total sum

my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
counter = 0  # Define a counter
for item in my_list:
    counter += item
    print(counter)  # this print will iterate one by one.

print(counter)  # Display single output.It should be more efficient rather than above print statement
